# Py DoS 
### by GithubAlt/hisoka

Inspired by Ha3MrX DDoS-Attack Project (py2)

## Tl;Dr
This is a fun project to get closer to my roots. I was at one time really intereted in comupter security and especially the use of denial-of-service attacks for activist purposes (e.g. Th3J35t3R) 

To this day, I am still interested in these topics but have fallen behind in terms of content knowledge. So I need to start practicing again.

This is a denial of serivce script free for anyone's use.
